    <h3>Working With Time</h3>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</strong></li>
      <p>During Sprint-1 tasks I didn't strictly follow any time-management technique. Though as the week progressed the time-blocks I set aside do to work did become more regular and consistent. What I mean is on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday I was trying to tackle all the tasks at once, read all the resources and all the assigned issues. I was also not making a conscious effort to distinguish between work-time and free-time, I might be juggling between watching a video and reading a development resource. What I found was that I didn't retain much of the information I read so my progress was slow. Friday, Saturday and Sunday have felt better by comparason. I think that is because of consciously allocating work time and also getting more familiar with the tasks I need to do. I spoke with Callan who had been trying the Pomodoro technique. It does sound like a great structure for time-management so I was mindful of that idea that short 'sprints' followed by a small breaks could be really efficient and I did try that, but not as strict as a proper pomodoro master might. </p>
        <p>The routine I developed was to wake up: eat, shower and give my brain some time to switch on, then work. I'd have lunch and try get some outdoor excercise time on my skateboard or bike (but the weather was really crappy so I couldn't for a few days!) then return to sprint tasks. I'd also put time aside in the evenings to do my tasks, though I found if I had a problem in the evening, I was less likely to be able to solve it.</p>
    <li><strong>what did you find interesting?</strong></li>
    <p>What I found interesting was the progression I made from the start of the week to the end and how my approach to Sprint-1 changed. I think as time went on and I spoke with my cohort about the tasks it made me more able to see little steps to complete the tasks, rather than view them as big, whole problems.</p>
    <li><strong>what worked for you?</strong></li>
    <p>Apporaching the tasks in smaller chunks, try to complete a few checkboxes rather than complete a whole Waffle-issue at once, that sort of thing. On Friday I met with a few people from the miro-miro cohort, talking with them, and watching over their shoulder as they problem-solved really helped me get a fresh look on some of the concepts I had found tricky. Listening to them talk about their experience was great, as working solo at home can get me frustrated especially if I can't find solutions.</p>
    <p> If I felt I was starting to get stressed out I would take a break, have a few deep breaths and stretch myself if I was feeling tight or sore.</p>
    <li><strong>which will you experiment further with?</strong></li>
    <p>I'd like to keep being mindful of how I'm feeling, making sure I've had enough to eat and drink, making sure I allow myself time for excersize or play. I think doing that helps my work sessions feel more focused.
    I want to keep in touch with my cohort too, I think meeting once or twice a week at least would be really helpful for me. The one session I had at EDA this week was really great, and I say that even though I couldnt bring my computer in to work there! The discussions were awesome.</p>
