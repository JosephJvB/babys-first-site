      <li><strong>What is grid based design?</strong></li>
      <p>Grid based design is the next step up from the box model, so the box model looks after individual elements and grid design is the idea that any webpage can be described as a grid. So when we see a website, what we are looking at is boxes arranged on a grid-layout. You can manipulate the grid in CSS by setting rules for .row and .col-x selectors.</p>
      <li><strong>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</strong></li>
       <p>Responsive webpages are important because people access websites from devices with a range of different screen resolutions. And it is important to developers that a users will be able to read and interact with a webpage whether they are on phone, tablet, laptop or PC. Responsive means the website will adjust its layout based on the size of the screen that it is being viewed on. So responsive layouts are a feature that make websites way more user friendly.
       <li><strong>What is semantic structure?</strong></li>
       Semantic tags are the HTML tags that are applied to the elements of a page. The semantic structure is the way these tags are arranged. The structure is used to create a page of content that reads well, h1 elements denote an important heading, while h2-4 introduce information inside the first heading. P tags suggest a paragraph, text element. Semantic structure is the blueprints for where your pages content will sit on the page.
       <li><strong>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on.</strong></li>
       I'm glad to learn about overflows. That will allow me to have concentrated sections of text that can be condensed in a small section but still be easy enough to read and understand. The normalize CSS link seems like a great add-on to any HTML file as a just-in-case mechanism.</p>
