      <p>
        I wasn't super sure about the whole 'scientifically measured happiness' thing. I also don't really like the 'life-hacks' approach but I'm really into the idea that we need to put time aside to think about our emotional and mental states. I don't understand any of the neuroscience in the paper but I'm sure an emotional intelligence course in the workplace would help cultivate better communication between people. Even if just being at the course means everyone involved becomes invested in thinking about one another and empathy and all that good stuff.

      <li><strong>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</strong></li>
       <p>
         Really nice, I've done a handful of Yoga classes over the last 2 years and they always emphasize a focus on breath and breathing. It's also a tactic my mum used to tell me to help me fall asleep at night, relaxing all muscles that are tense and focus on breathing. It's sort of like typing clear on the command line, it lets you return to whatever task you were doing but with less mental clutter. Harder to do when you're stressed out but taking a few minutes to chill out like that always helps me.
