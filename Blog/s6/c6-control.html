                <li><strong>When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</strong></li>
                <p>
                  I haven't noticed any major disproportionate emotional responses while programming. I have certainly had moments when I feel frustrated and upset but I don't feel like those moments were caused by any one 'trigger'. I cant say I have been terribly upset by anything in the Sprints so far.

                  One thing that can be a problem for me is having someone or something distract me when I'm trying to take in information or solve a problem. It can be a real pain trying to read or write something only to be interrupted.
                </p>
                <li><strong>How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?</strong></li>
                <p>
                  I really like the idea, it reminds me of the emotional intelligence and self awareness readings we did the other week. Giving yourself a bit of time to process something, and make a small disconnect between action and response. It gives you a little time to think about the circumstances and see things from a more 3rd person perspective rather than making an impulsive, 1st person response.
                  I know sometimes even when I'm asked or told something I can act or speak quite defensively out of reflex even to the most innocent questions, which is something I do try to keep in mind and work on. So when I'm told something I do try to think about it for a second and not have a knee-jerk defensive response. I dont like being defensive since it makes for really closed communication and honestly it's less fun. I really enjoy when I'm able to be open about my mistakes and successes and joke around about both of them.
                  I did this reading while I was staying out of town with a group of friends and I remember afterwards feeling really comfortable with talking or being quiet, listening and responding without being super defensive or impulsive. I still made mistakes and said the wrong thing every now and again, but I think I delt with those mistakes better than if I had been stressed out and impulsive. The think, pause, respond thing is less about getting things right 100% of the time, but more about giving you the best chance to absorb information and process a good course of action.
