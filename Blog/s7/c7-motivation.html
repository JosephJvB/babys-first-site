             <h2>My Core Values</h2>
              <ul>
                 <li><strong>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</strong></li>
                  <p>
                    Pleasure, passion and purpose are described as 3 ways that we get happiness. So 'pleasure' is the stimulus - instant reward kind of happiness we might get from a great meal or watching a cool TV show. Passion is more active, when we are taking part in an activity that rewards us with happiness, like a hobby. I get this from skateboarding and biking. Higher purpose is a happiness that comes from the knowledge that you are involved in activities that are intrinsically good. It could be something that is personally productive, like a web development course, or charity work, or helping out your family with something. It's belonging to a group or a cause.
                  </p>
                 <strong>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise:</strong>
                 <li><strong>What are your core values?</strong></li>
                  <p>
                    I think a lot of core values are shared among people, be kind, do no harm, love thy neighbour, help those in need. Not that we might explicitly state that but those seem to be the sort of things people care about. I also do what I can to look after myself. I'm the primary carer for myself, so if I dont look after me I wont have much fun. I also care a lot about the people who are close to me, family and close friends.
                    Something I think about is being polite and having good manners, it's really easy to say please and thank you. I try to treat everyone with politeness, I have to try extra hard when I'm in a bad mood, so when I'm feeling like that I'll do my best to at least not be impolite.
                  </p>
                 <li><strong>What do you stand for?</strong></li>
                  <p>
                    Respect I suppose, to make sure every person is respected. No discrimination, that sort of stuff. I feel like I'm applying for a Mrs Universe pagent "I want to end world poverty". I'm not publicly involved in social justice movements, so I dont have any real agenda there. I stand for moral respect, but I DANCE for a good tune :) It's a good feeling.
                  </p>
                 <li><strong>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</strong></li>
                  <p>
                    It was cool, it's strengthening that idea that you can make distance between yourself and your emotions. And I love a chance to chill and breathe, I am conciously making time every day to do that sort of thing. "One mindful breath a day".
                  </p>
                 <li><strong>Any other musings?</strong></li>
                  <p>
                    Not too much to add, this Search Inside Yourself isnt the sort of book I would read out of my own choice, but there are some parts that I quite like so that's nice. Not all of it! But there are enough interesting pieces to prevent it from becoming a total chore.
