            <h2>Mindfulness Conversation</h2>
              <ul>
               <li><strong>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</strong></li>
                <p>
                  I had my conversation with my mum! She's in town for a week or so. What I took away from it was that when you have exculsive control over the conversation it really lets you work out a good blueprint of whatever it is that's going on with you. I spoke about what I'd done today, how I was feeling physically and then what I have in mind that I'm going to do in the near future. Mum then talked about what sort of arrangements she's planning for her drive up to Auckland with Dad and the stuff she has already organised. I think Mum enjoyed it, she told me I need to sit facing the person more and look more engaged in the conversation, she was saying it's helpful in getting the other person to keep their flow of conversation going. But I liked the chance to speak uninterrupted to sort of set things on the table, after that it gives a good oportunity to discuss the things you have brought up. I can imagine that format would work well if you're working on a collaborative project. Let each person talk exclusively and then go back and forth about what you've each said.
                </p>
               <li><strong>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</strong></li>
                <p>
                  I will definitely try the 'one mindful breath a day' tactic. It's something I sort of do already, not on schedule but I do like to mentally step away from whatever I'm doing for a moment and take a breath.
                  The buddy one seems great too. I think using the Slack channel is a decent if not perfect way of having that buddy-dialouge with other cohort members. Face to face being the preferred alternative.
                  And do less that you can? That makes sense to me, if you exhaust yourself trying to be mindful, you won't be very effective in anything else you do haha.
                </p>
               <li><strong>Any other musings?</strong></li>
                 <p>
                   Sad that Joseph Quested is leaving! He's been great to us so far. In my 3rd week check-in we had a quick chat about videogames because the hangout was empty and videogames are close to my heart so I appreciated that.
                   Also I'm happy to know that Jack and Harrison will be stepping in for Joseph, since both of them are in Wellington we have the option of seeing them in EDA. I'm sure they'll be great, I know Jack already but not sure I know Harrison.
                   I'm going to play some of Joseph's games when I get a chance ;D
