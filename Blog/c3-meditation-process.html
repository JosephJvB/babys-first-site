            <h2>Do I meditate?</h2>
              <ul>
               <li><strong>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</strong></li>
                <p>
                 I don't meditate, not because I'm opposed to the idea, I don't think it's useless and it's certainly not harmful. I think it's an excellent excercise for smarter more peaceful people than me. I like to think I have my own interpretations of meditation. Sometimes I'll take time to breathe and sit, or lie down, or walk or whatever but I'm not conciously saying "yes this is meditation time".
                </p>
               <li><strong>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</strong></li>
                <p>
                  The chapter talks about mediation as a thing you can dedicate time to and improve at, I liked the bicycle analogy and I like that whole concept. I think a lot of people think mediation is supposed to achieve some ultra-serene state and then when they try it at their friends yoga class they feel cheated that they're still sitting on a mat on a floor surrounded by sweaty people. I still don't like the whole "happiness forever" vibe though. I think meditation is a tool you can use to chill out and de-stress, not make you immune to sadness. I think if anything meditation is a way for you to deal with emotions, happiness, sadness, stress and everything else. It's great but you still need to live a balanced life outside of your meditation time - or you'll feel awful no matter how still you sit and how deep you breathe.
                </p>
               <li><strong>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</strong></li>
                <p>
                  I liked the posture guide, I think that's useful. And the description of how to take and release a deep breathe from Yvonne Ginsberg.
                </p>
               <li><strong>Any other musings?</strong></li>
                <p>
                  I find whenever I have a long-term task, like this phase-0, I will develop de-stress(aka: procrastination) coping mechanisms. Sometimes it's friends, or skateboarding, often it's videogames. The videogame I've been playing most is Quake 1. It's only a single player 'campaign' and I've beaten it over and over but I still enjoy playing it. I've gotten my time down to about half an hour to beat the game start to finish so it's really quite a good break from doing this course work. only downside is no exercise and I'm still at my computer, but I do make time for active stuff too.
