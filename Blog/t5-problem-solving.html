               <li><strong>What was the problem?</strong></li>
                <p>
                  I was stuck with the waffle task 5.2. The task was to use Java Script to alter the classes of HTML elements in response to events. I was able to copy the provided example to get mouseenter and mouseleave working but I had trouble getting the page to respond to a mouse click.
                </p>
               <li><strong>What problem solving techniques did you use?</strong></li>
                <p>
                  The pseudocode was provided by the waffle task, "make the div respond to a mouse click event" so I had that already. I did re-watch the resource videos on JS since I thought they were useful. I did try something, I had tried to set the eventListener to respond 'onclick' which I thought was the correct JS syntax. It turns out that the correct way to write that is just 'click.'
                  I reached this solution by accessing the repo of another member of Miromiro2017 on github, and viewing their solution. I didn't spot the problem right away, so I would copy sections of their working code into mine to try to locate the problem. Eventually I saw that I had written the wrong thing, and fixed it. So I suppose I went to peers for help indirectly.
                  The problem was a result of me not knowing all the JS notation so I'll be sure to google that sort of problem in the future.
                </p>
               <li><strong>How did you feel throughout the process?</strong></li>
                <p>
                  It was frustrating to have written what I thought was correct code but to have it not work. And it was tricky because I didnt know where the problem was coming from.
                  I felt like I was cheating a bit by checking another persons solution because I wanted to solve the problem myself, but I decided as long as I worked backwards from the right answer to understand WHY it was the right answer then I'm still learning in the end.
                  And it was a relief to end up with working code.
                </p>
               <li><strong>What did you learn?</strong></li>
                <p>
                  I learnt that while I understood functions and looping, I didn't know the syntax of eventListeners which meant I wrote the wrong thing! I also like the idea of being able to view the answers that people in my cohort submit. This morning someone had an issue with a task, so I looked at their code and found the fault to point them in the right direction.
                  I dont want to rely on my peers to find the answers all the time, because I really do want to learn this stuff for myself. But I also think it's useful to see what other people come up with too.

             <li><strong>.map()</strong></li>
              <p>
                Prints the target array after it has been processed by the function the array is referred to.
              </p>
             <li><strong>.filter()</strong></li>
              <p>
                Prints the target array but only includes elements that proved TRUE by whatever function the array is attached to.
              </p>
             <li><strong>.reduce()</strong></li>
              <p>
                "Apply a function against an accumulator and each value of the array (from left-to-right) as to reduce it to a single value."
                This is the definition provided by the resource page. I'm not sure what an accumulator is, I understand the array is processed left to right, and reduced to a single value. Does that mean all items in the array need to be numbers? Or is the single value a result of the item numbers in the array.
                I'm sure I'll understand this one better as I come to use it.
