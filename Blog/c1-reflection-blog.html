    <h3>Sprint 1, reflection</h3>

    <ul>
      <strong><li>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</li></strong>
      <p>From what I heard coming into the EDA course, and what I'm getting from the Fireside chat video is that both EDA and DBC both push for a very collaborative approach to problem solving. It is a bootcamp, and typically bootcamps are meant to be intense and challenging so I'm expecting challenges but it seems like both EDA and DBC encourage and nurture peoples ability to communicate rather than try to pressure people into individual success. </p>
    <strong><li>What are your impressions?</li></strong>
    <p>It is only early days for me as a part of EDA, and phase-0 is the least collaborative part of the course so I haven't got the chance to experience the full teamwork that will come later. Though I did spend some time in EDA with people from my cohort and I left feeling really great about the course and the place I was at so I'm looking forward to the next phases. I'll also say that coming in I guess I had assumed that phase-0 might be a not very engaging introductory phase but I'm pleased to say that I was wrong, I'm getting a really nice sense of progress as I complete the set tasks.</p>
    <strong><li>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</li></strong>
    <p>So far I EDA feels like a good fit for me, I've felt really welcome on-site, communicating with the staff and my cohort. It doesn't feel like a chore to engage with this stuff, which might be a slight honey-moon effect but I definitely like what is happening so far. I like the idea of promoting physical development with Yoga, and seeing people with bikes and skateboards - that's totally my cup of tea.</p>
    <strong><li>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</li></strong>
    <p>I think most of my first expectations were focused on the graduation side, most of my questions were about how EDA gets graduates in touch with employers (because I don't know the 'job-climate' of the tech sector). What has changed is I had not expected to be as engaged with phase-0, I thought it might be very slow and boring. The reality is I've had to try and apply myself and it's been great.</p>
    <strong><li>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</li></strong>
    <p>Definitely yes, excited to be a part of EDA. Also yes I am nervous, I think the more I get into the material I become more aware of how much I don't know. I hope I can keep up with the pace of the bootcamp. I'll certainly try! Also I think we are well looked after but we aren't babysat so I do have to be self-driven which is great, but there's less of a saftey-net. On the other hand I think it's a great system where students can join later cohorts if things become too much.</p>
