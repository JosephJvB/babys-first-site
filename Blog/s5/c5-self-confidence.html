             <h2>Self-Awareness</h2>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self-awareness?</strong></li>
                  <p>
                    I'd say that self-awareness is a subsection of mindfulness. In coding terms, mindfulness is the parent element of self-awareness haha. Both talk about emotional intelligence, understanding that you are feeling an emotion and trying to understand why you're feeling that way. Grumpy because you're tired, happy because someone paid you a nice compliment, anxious because you have an important meeting coming up. The idea is that if you can make yourself aware of that relationship you can start to regulate yourself better.
                  </p>
                <li><strong>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</strong></li>
                 <p>
                   I followed through the 'scan-body' steps, but I didnt sit for a minute at each step, I guess I'm impatient for my mindfulness. It was a good experience, I'm always suprised at what muscles I have tensed up without thinking about it, so taking a second to release face muscles, shoulders and back is really good for me.
                 </p>
                <li><strong>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</strong></li>
                  <p>
                    I think it's a really healthy way of approaching emotion. Not that we are supposed to reach some emotionless state, even if we could that would be boring! But just like relaxing your muscles, it's really good to take a second to be aware of your emotions, relax them if they've been like that for too long. Or do something about them. "Wow, I'm really distracted and unproductive, I'll go get something to eat and have a walk outside and come back to this task."
                    When you step back and think about what emotion you are able to reset a bit, and decide how you want to approach the next thing.
